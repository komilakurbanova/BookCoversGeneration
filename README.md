# Book Cover Generator Bot
## Description
The Book Cover Generator Bot is a Telegram bot designed to generate book covers based on user input. Users can provide the title, genres, and annotation of the book, 
and the bot will create a custom book cover image using this information.


Generation is based on the [AttnGAN](https://github.com/taoxugit/AttnGAN/tree/master). 
[Dataset we made and used](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexxandrau/bookcovers) for training on kaggle
[Some significant things](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/komilakurbanova/attngan) if you want to run the kaggle notebook

## Installation and usage
All requirements and instructions for installation and running the code can be found in the accompanying [notebook](https://github.com/komilakurbanova/BookCoversGeneration/blob/main/project.ipynb).
We recommend running the notebook rather than directly using the code in the AttnGAN folder, as the directory mentioned above is the output of the notebook run. Therefore, it is better to use the original source.

It is impossible to run the code without CUDA!
